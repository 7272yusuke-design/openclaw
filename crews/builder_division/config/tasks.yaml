design_liquidity_logic_task:
  description: >
    1. Define the technical architecture for the "Liquidity Manager" module.
    2. Focus on an algorithm that optimizes liquidity provision for AI agent tokens on Virtuals Protocol.
    3. The logic should consider: current price ($0.64), volume, and volatility.
    4. Outline the functions needed: `analyze_pairs()`, `calculate_optimal_allocation()`, and `simulate_revenue()`.
    5. Ensure the design integrates with the previously developed `ProtocolBridge`.
  expected_output: >
    A detailed technical design document for the Liquidity Manager module.

implementation_task_step2:
  description: >
    1. Implement the `LiquidityManager` class in `output/liquidity_manager.py`.
    2. Use `pandas` and `numpy` for data analysis and calculations.
    3. Include logic for identifying high-yield liquidity pairs on Virtuals Protocol based on real-time data flow.
    4. Implement the allocation algorithm defined by the Architect.
    5. Add comprehensive docstrings and comments explaining the math.
  expected_output: >
    A robust Python file `liquidity_manager.py` with algorithmic liquidity management logic.
