    1. Design the integration of "GAME Framework" (from virtuals-sdk) into our agent.
    2. Define how to use `Agent`, `Worker`, and `Function` classes from the SDK.
    3. Include a "Twitter Integration" design where the agent uses a `TwitterWorker` to post updates.
    4. Ensure the `LiquidityManager` logic can be called as a custom `Function` within the GAME framework.

    A Technical Blueprint for the GAME-enabled Agent Runner.

    1. Write the Python code for `output/game_ready_runner.py`.
    2. Implement the `GAME` logic: initialize a Virtuals Agent, add a Liquidity Worker and a Twitter Worker.
    3. Ensure the code imports from `libs/virtuals-sdk` correctly.
    4. Add a feature to post autonomous activity logs to Twitter (mocked if no key).
  expected_output: >
    A production-ready `game_ready_runner.py` integrated with Virtuals SDK.
