technical_design_task:
  description: >
    1. Read the provided business planning document.
    2. Define the overall software architecture (files, classes, modules).
    3. Break down the development into a numbered list of tasks (e.g., Task 1: API connection, Task 2: Logic).
    4. Specify the recommended LLM for each task (e.g., DeepSeek for routine, Claude for complex).

implementation_task_step1:
  description: >
    1. Review the Technical Design for the "Protocol Bridge" module.
    2. Write the Python code for `protocol_bridge.py`.
    3. The code must interact with the Virtuals SDK (assume the SDK is in `libs/virtuals-sdk`).
    4. Implement basic functions: connect to the protocol, fetch agent status, and send logs.
    5. Save the code to a file named `output/protocol_bridge.py`.
  expected_output: >
    A fully functional Python file `protocol_bridge.py` with necessary logic and comments.
