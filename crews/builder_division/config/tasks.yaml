technical_design_task:
  description: >
    1. Read the provided business planning document.
    2. Define the overall software architecture (files, classes, modules).
    3. Break down the development into a numbered list of tasks (e.g., Task 1: API connection, Task 2: Logic).
    4. Specify the recommended LLM for each task (e.g., DeepSeek for routine, Claude for complex).
  expected_output: >
    A comprehensive Technical Design Document including a detailed development task list.

testing_task_step1:
  description: >
    1. Review the generated code in `output/protocol_bridge.py`.
    2. Write a Python unit test file `test_protocol_bridge.py` using `unittest` or simple `assert` statements.
    3. The test should verify that the `ProtocolBridge` class can be initialized and that its methods (connect, fetch_status) are callable.
    4. Use mocking or dummy values for actual network connections to avoid API calls.
    5. Save the test file to `output/test_protocol_bridge.py`.
  expected_output: >
    A Python test script `test_protocol_bridge.py` that successfully verifies the module.
