implement_sentiment_components:
  description: >
    Based on the generated 'sentiment_worker_skeleton.py', implement the concrete logic for the following components to make the worker functional:

    1. **KeywordMatcher**: 
       - Implement the `process` method.
       - It should accept text data and count occurrences of specific keywords (e.g., "$VIRTUAL", "buy", "sell", "moon", "fud").
       - Return a dictionary of counts.

    2. **VolumeSpikeDetector**: 
       - Implement logic to detect if the current volume exceeds a threshold.
       - For this iteration, implement a simple logic: compare input count against a `baseline_threshold` (int) provided in config.
       - Return True/False.

    3. **MockDataFetcher**: 
       - Create a class to simulate fetching social data.
       - It should return a list of dummy text messages (e.g., ["Buy $VIRTUAL now!", "I am selling..."]) to test the pipeline.

    4. **Integration & Main Loop**: 
       - Update the `SentimentWorker` class to initialize these components.
       - Add a `run_once()` method that fetches mock data, passes it through Matcher -> Detector, and outputs a `SentimentSignal`.

  expected_output: >
    Complete, runnable Python source code. It must include the `KeywordMatcher`, `VolumeSpikeDetector`, `MockDataFetcher` classes, and a `if __name__ == "__main__":` block that demonstrates the worker processing mock data and printing the result.
