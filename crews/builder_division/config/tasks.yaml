    Based on the "Micro-Agent Architecture" philosophy, design a fault-tolerant, standalone "SentimentWorker" for the Virtuals Protocol agent.

    1. **Decoupled Architecture**:
       - Design the worker to operate independently. Even if it crashes, the LiquidityWorker must continue safe operations.
       - Define a strict, read-only API contract for data output.

    2. **Composition over Generation**:
       - Instead of designing a monolithic AI model, design a pipeline using "Verified Components" (e.g., KeywordMatcher, VolumeSpikeDetector, InfluenceWeighter).
       - The Builder's job is to configure the thresholds and weights of these components, not to write raw parsing logic from scratch.

    3. **Double-Check Mechanism**:
       - Include a "Sanity Check" layer in the design. (e.g., If sentiment flips 180 degrees in 1 minute, flag for human/Monitor review instead of auto-execution).

    4. **Output Definition**:
       - Define the JSON schema for the `SentimentSignal` that triggers the Builder.
       - Example: { "target": "VIRTUAL", "signal": "BUY", "confidence": 0.85, "trigger_source": "high_kol_consensus" }

    A Technical Specification for the SentimentWorker (Markdown), focusing on interface definitions, component composition, and fail-safe mechanisms.

    1. Review the Technical Specification provided by the Architect.
    2. Create a Python class structure for the `SentimentWorker` that reflects the decoupled design.
    3. Implement the "Sanity Check" logic (Circuit Breaker) as a reusable component.
    4. Do NOT implement the full fetching logic yet; focus on the architectural skeleton and data interfaces.
  expected_output: >
    Python source code for the `SentimentWorker` skeleton and `SanityCheck` component.
