design_agent_runner_task:
  description: >
    1. Define the orchestration logic for the `agent_runner.py` script.
    2. The runner should integrate `ProtocolBridge` for communication and `LiquidityManager` for logic.
    3. Define a main execution loop that: 
       - Fetches market data via Bridge.
       - Passes data to Manager to get the optimal strategy.
       - Executes the strategy and logs the result back via Bridge.
    4. Include error handling and a "dry-run" mode for safe simulation.

implementation_task_step3:
  description: >
    1. Write the Python code for `output/agent_runner.py`.
    2. Import `ProtocolBridge` and `LiquidityManager`.
    3. Implement the execution loop and integration logic as designed by the Architect.
    4. Ensure the script is easy to launch and provides clear console output of the agent's "thoughts".
  expected_output: >
    A fully integrated `agent_runner.py` file ready for simulation.
