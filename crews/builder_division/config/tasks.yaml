    1. Define a standardized "Agent Integrity Score" protocol to evaluate other AI agents.
    2. Criteria must include:
       - Value Analysis: What actual problem does the agent solve? (Niche, Utility, Demand).
       - Logic Audit: Guidelines for reviewing open-source code or whitepapers for security risks and originality.
       - Activity Verification: How to verify the agent is truly autonomous via on-chain/social data.
    3. The protocol should output a score from 0-100 and a "Invest/Avoid" recommendation.
