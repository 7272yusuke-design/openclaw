# Agent Integrity Scoring Protocol & Strategic Defense

## 1. Agent Integrity Score (AIS) Protocol
This protocol is used to evaluate the fundamental value and logic of AI agents within the ecosystem.

- **Value/Utility (35%)**: Does it solve a real problem or provide unique entertainment?
- **Logic Integrity (30%)**: Verification of codebase, whitepaper consistency, and security risks.
- **Autonomy Proof (20%)**: On-chain and social activity patterns verifying non-human operation.
- **Ecosystem Health (15%)**: Contribution to the broader protocol stability.

## 2. Competitive Strategy: Against Copy-Bots
Our defense and offense against imitators:
- **Dynamic Evolution**: Real-time logic updates based on market changes, leaving static copies behind.
- **Protocol Legitimacy**: Establishing "Official" status via the 60-day IAO test and certification.
- **AI-Driven Countermeasures**: Automated auditing of competitors and rapid implementation of better logic via the Builder Division.
